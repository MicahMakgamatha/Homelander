    <h2>Who is Homelander </h2>
    <p> The Homelander (John) is a supervillain in the comic book series The Boys, created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. The leader of a group of hedonistic and reckless superheroes funded by Vought dubbed The Seven, and the archenemy of CIA black ops agent Billy Butcher, the Homelander is depicted as an arrogant narcissist thought by Butcher to be a sadistic psychopath who cares little about the well-being of those he professes to protect. Initially serving as the primary antagonist of the series, the Homelander is eventually superseded by Black Noir, revealed to be a deranged clone of the Homelander created to kill and replace him if he ever went rogue, who framed him for the rape and death of Butcher's wife (and various other acts of murder, cannibalism, and necrophilia), as part of a plan to gradually drive him insane in order to be allowed by Vought to do so, having been driven insane himself by a lack of purpose.</p>

    <h2>The S7ven</h2>
    <p> The Seven is the most popular and powerful American Superhero team owned by Vought International. With Homelander being the only one directly created by Vought, all other members of The Seven and replacements were confirmed to have been raised outside of Vought (excluding Black Noir who's background is still unknown). While The Seven operate as a superhero team and stop crimes, in reality, every action is only fuel to increase Vought's stock prices and Public Relations. Original members of The Seven include: Homelander, Queen Maeve, Black Noir, Mister Marathon, The Deep, Translucent and Lamplighter. What happened to Mister Marathon is currently unknown, but afterwards, he was replaced by A-Train as The Seven's speedster.</p>

    <h2>Development </h2>
    <p>The character was designed as an evil version of Captain America and Superman. His cape pulled to the left resembles the first costume of Captain Marvel a.k.a. Shazam.[4] Homelander's backstory in the original comics is similar to that in the television adaption of The Boys.[5] The character was toned down for television in comparison to his comics counterpart.[6]

        Garth Ennis describes Homelander as: "an almost entirely negative character. He is really just a series of unpleasant urges kept in check by his own intelligence, which is enough to understand that he can have anything he wants so long as he doesn't push his luck too far." Also: "It might help to think of the Homelander as having all the self-control of letâ€™s say a fourteen-year-old."[7] </p>
